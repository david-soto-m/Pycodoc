# Pycodoc

# This project is under severe maintenance

The idea behind this app is to centralize your documentation. With this app you can easily read the documentation of the projects you have all around your computer.

This tool was developed by an idiot. You should really try zeal instead of this if you are planning on having loads of *official* documentation

## Features

* Tabbing and splitting
* History
* Customizable shortcuts
* Style your files (but not too much because it's limited by qt itself)
* Easily add new docs and style sheets
* View HTML from other file formats (when pandoc is enabled)
* Create different styles easily

## Short tutorial

Drag and drop your files onto the app or to the search bar. You can also describe a path in the search bar or in the files configuration.

Do checkout the settings if you want to enable pandoc-associated functionality, or describe your shortcuts.
